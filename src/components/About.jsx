                    <p><strong>Hi I'm Jonathan Bridges</strong> and I'm a Software Developer. My interest in programming began at my last job, where I could oftentimes resolve implementation issues for our clients using my knowledge of HTML5 and CSS3. However, I increasingly found myself unable to provide adequate solutions without the help of an Engineer. It bothered me being someone who could point out problems but couldn't come up with answers.</p>
                    <p>Recently I've been expanding my skillset with the aim of providing more value in my next role. Technologies I've been using include React/Redux, JavaScript, Ruby, Rails, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Express, and Node. You can view my current and past projects <Link className="position" style={{}} activeClass="active" to="anchor" spy={true} smooth={true} duration={500}>below</Link>.</p>
                    <p>Personally, I love music. Iâ€˜ve studied audio technology and play several instruments. I grew up in Vermont, where I learned to love being outdoors. I enjoy bicycling, hiking, camping, and snowboarding.</p>
